Autonomous Market Analyst: Building AI Agents for Deep Research

# Overview

In this project, I developed an Autonomous Market Analyst using AI agents capable of conducting deep market research. By leveraging large language models and autonomous agent frameworks, the system can collect, analyze, and summarize information across multiple sources, simulating the work of a human market research analyst.

# Workflow

    1)Agent Setup
    
        Configured autonomous AI agents with predefined roles and objectives.
        
        Used language models as reasoning engines to drive research tasks.
    
    2)Data Collection
    
        Retrieved and parsed relevant information from online resources and structured datasets.
    
    3)Analysis
    
        Processed collected data for patterns, insights, and trends in market domains.
    
    4)Summarization
    
        Generated comprehensive reports with coherent, concise insights.
    
    5)Evaluation
    
        Compared outputs with human-driven research for accuracy, depth, and reliability.
