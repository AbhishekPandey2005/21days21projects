Smart Segmentation: Unlocking Customer Personas with AI

# Overview: 

This project uses unsupervised learning to perform customer segmentation. By clustering customers based on behavioral and demographic data, it uncovers meaningful personas that businesses can use for targeted marketing and personalization.

# Workflow

      1) Data Loading — Import customer data using Pandas and prepare it for analysis.
      
      2) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) — Use Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly to visualize distributions, correlations, and potential clusters.
      
      3) Preprocessing — Apply StandardScaler to normalize features for clustering.
      
      4) Clustering Methods —
      
          KMeans Clustering for customer segmentation.
      
          Hierarchical Clustering to compare grouping structures.
      
      5) Visualization — Create 2D/3D cluster plots and dendrograms to interpret customer segments.
      
      6) Evaluation — Analyze cluster characteristics to define customer personas.
      
      7) Conclusion — Segmentation reveals distinct customer groups; improvements may involve silhouette scoring, DBSCAN, or incorporating advanced embeddings.
