Predicting Market Housing Trends

# Overview

In this project, I analyzed housing market data to identify patterns and trends that can help predict future housing prices. The project combines data preprocessing, feature engineering, and predictive modeling to forecast housing market movements.

# Workflow

      1) Data Collection & Cleaning
      
          Loaded housing market datasets.
          
          Handled missing values and normalized numerical features.
      
      2) Feature Engineering
      
          Selected key predictors such as location, size, age, and market conditions.
      
      3) Model Building
      
          Trained regression-based models for housing price prediction.
      
          Compared model performance using evaluation metrics.
      
      4) Visualization
      
          Used charts and graphs to illustrate housing market trends and predictions.
