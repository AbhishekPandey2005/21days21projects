Advanced Vision AI: Fast-Tracking Image Classification with Transfer Learning

# Overview

In this project, I implemented Transfer Learning to accelerate image classification tasks. By leveraging pretrained deep learning models, the project demonstrates how to quickly adapt powerful architectures to new datasets with minimal training effort.

# Workflow

      1) Data Preparation
      
          Loaded and preprocessed the image dataset.
      
          Applied augmentation techniques to improve model generalization.
      
      2) Model Setup
      
          Imported pretrained CNN architectures (e.g., ResNet, VGG).
      
          Replaced final layers to match the new classification task.
      
      3) Training & Fine-Tuning
      
          Trained the modified model on the dataset.
      
          Experimented with freezing and unfreezing layers for efficiency.
      
      4) Evaluation
      
          Measured accuracy and performance on validation data.
      
          Visualized predictions and classification results.
