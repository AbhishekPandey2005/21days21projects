Preventing Customer Churn with Feature Transformation

# Overview

In this project, I focused on customer churn prediction by leveraging feature transformation techniques. The goal was to improve predictive accuracy by engineering features that capture customer behavior more effectively.

# Workflow

      1) Data Preparation
      
          Cleaned and structured customer datasets.
      
          Addressed categorical encoding and missing data.
      
      2) Feature Transformation
      
          Applied scaling, encoding, and interaction features.
      
          Created derived features to highlight customer engagement.
      
      3) Model Training
      
          Built classification models to predict churn probability.
      
          Evaluated model performance using precision, recall, and F1-score.
      
      4) Visualization
      
          Displayed churn patterns and feature importance.
