Talk to Your Data: Building a Natural Language to SQL Generator

# Overview

In this project, I created a Natural Language to SQL generator that allows users to query databases using plain English. By integrating NLP models with SQL translation logic, the system enables seamless interaction with structured data.

# Workflow

      1) Data & Database Setup
      
          Prepared structured datasets and connected them to a SQL engine.
      
      2) Model Integration
      
          Used a language model to parse natural language queries.
      
      3) SQL Translation
      
          Converted parsed queries into executable SQL statements.
      
      4) Execution & Output
      
          Ran generated SQL queries on the database.
      
          Displayed results in tabular format.
