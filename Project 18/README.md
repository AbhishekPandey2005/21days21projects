Chat with Your Knowledge Base: Building a Powerful RAG Chatbot

# Overview:

This project builds a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot that can interact with a custom knowledge base. Using LangChain and Google Generative AI, the chatbot retrieves relevant documents and combines them with LLM reasoning to generate accurate, context-aware responses.

# Workflow

1) Data Loading — Import and preprocess documents (e.g., CSV/structured data) using LangChain loaders.

2) Embedding & Retrieval — Convert documents into vector embeddings and store them for efficient retrieval.

3) Prompting & Parsing — Design structured prompts with ChatPromptTemplate and parse outputs with StrOutputParser.

4) RAG Pipeline — Integrate retrieval + LLM (ChatGoogleGenerativeAI) to answer queries grounded in the knowledge base.

5) Conversation Flow — Manage user/system messages with HumanMessage and SystemMessage classes.

6) Evaluation — Test chatbot responses against queries; verify grounding and factual accuracy.

7) Conclusion — The project demonstrates how RAG enhances chatbot reliability; future improvements include multi-document retrieval, vector DB integration (like Pinecone/FAISS), and memory persistence.
