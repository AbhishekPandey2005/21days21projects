Build Your Own GPT: Creating a Custom Text Generation Engine


# Overview

In this project, I built a custom text generation engine inspired by GPT architecture. Using Hugging Face Transformers and PyTorch, I explored how to load a pretrained GPT-2 model, tokenize text, fine-tune on specific datasets, and generate coherent outputs. This project demonstrates how modern text generation models can be customized and extended for diverse applications.

# Workflow

    1) Model & Tokenizer Setup
    
        Loaded GPT2LMHeadModel and GPT2Tokenizer from Hugging Face Transformers.
    
    2) Text Preprocessing
    
        Converted input prompts into tokenized sequences for model processing.
    
    3) Text Generation
    
        Implemented different decoding strategies:
    
        Greedy decoding
    
        Top-k sampling
    
        Nucleus (top-p) sampling
    
    4) Fine-tuning (Optional)
    
        Adapted GPT-2 on custom datasets to specialize outputs for specific tasks.
    
    5) Evaluation
    
        Generated multiple text sequences.
        
        Analyzed coherence, creativity, and diversity of generated content.

# Results
