Predicting Future Store Sales with AI

# Overview

In this project, I built a machine learning pipeline to predict future sales for stores using historical data. The model captures seasonal patterns, promotional effects, and store-specific factors to forecast sales more accurately.

# Workflow

    1) Data Loading & Cleaning
    
        Imported sales datasets.
    
        Addressed missing values and normalized numerical features.
    
    2) Feature Engineering
    
        Added time-based features (e.g., month, day, seasonality).
    
        Incorporated promotional and external data when available.
    
    3) Model Development
    
        Trained machine learning models to predict future sales.
    
        Evaluated models using accuracy and error metrics.
    
    4) Visualization
    
        Displayed historical vs predicted sales trends.
