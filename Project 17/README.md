# Build Your Own Intelligent Internet Search Engine

# Overview

This project demonstrates how to build an AI-powered intelligent internet search engine that can crawl websites, extract structured information, and process it   intelligently using language models. The system uses crawl4ai with async crawling strategies, schema-based extraction, and LLM-powered configurations to perform domain-specific searches such as job listings, AI news articles, and deep web crawling.

# Workflow

    1) Crawler Setup

          Configure AsyncWebCrawler with AsyncPlaywrightCrawlerStrategy for efficient web scraping.
          
          Define browser settings such as headless mode and user-agent.

    2) Extraction Strategies

          Schema-based extraction: Use CSS selectors to extract structured data like job titles, locations, and URLs.
          
          LLM-based extraction: Provide natural language prompts to an LLM for flexible data parsing and summarization.

    3) Jobs Search Engine

          Crawl Google Careers using structured CSS selectors.
          
          Extract job titles, locations, and links.
          
          Store results in JSON format for later use.

    4) AI News Scraper

          Crawl TechCrunch AI news articles.
          
          Use natural language prompts to extract title, URL, summary, author, and date.
          
          Save results in Markdown (ai_news.md) for easy reading.

    5) Deep Crawling

          Configure multi-level crawling using max_depth.
          
          Collect information across linked pages while avoiding unnecessary recursion.

    6) Evaluation & Results

          Extracted data is saved in structured JSON or Markdown formats.

          Results are validated for correctness, readability, and adaptability across websites.

    7) Conclusion

          The project shows how AI-enhanced crawling can go beyond keyword-based search.
    
          Extensions may include:

              Multi-domain search engines
    
              Semantic query understanding
    
              Integration with vector databases for advanced retrieval
    
              Real-time search dashboards
