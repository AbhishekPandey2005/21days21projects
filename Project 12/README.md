Real-World Computer Vision: Building a Real-Time Object Detector & Face Resolution Enhancement

# Overview

In this project, I explored real-world computer vision applications by implementing a real-time object detection system and a face resolution enhancement model. The project demonstrates how advanced deep learning models can be applied for practical vision-based tasks.

# Workflow

      1) Data & Model Setup
      
          Used pre-trained computer vision models for object detection and face enhancement.
      
          Configured pipelines for real-time video input.
      
      2) Object Detection
      
          Applied deep learning models to detect multiple objects in real time.
      
          Implemented bounding box visualization to highlight detections.
      
      3) Face Resolution Enhancement
      
          Processed low-resolution face images.
      
          Applied super-resolution techniques to improve clarity and detail.
      
      4) Integration
      
          Combined detection and enhancement into a single workflow.
