Data Storytelling: Analyzing Survival on the Titanic

# Overview

In this project, I explored the Titanic dataset to uncover insights about survival rates using data storytelling techniques. By combining exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualization, the project demonstrates how raw data can be transformed into meaningful narratives that highlight important patterns and trends.

# Workflow

    1) Data Collection & Preprocessing
    
          Loaded the Titanic dataset.
    
          Handled missing values and cleaned categorical features.
    
    2) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
    
          Analyzed survival patterns across different passenger groups (age, gender, class, etc.).
    
    3) Data Visualization
    
          Created intuitive plots and charts to communicate insights effectively.
    
    4) Storytelling with Data
    
          Framed the analysis as a narrative, making the findings clear and engaging.
