Building an AI-Powered Newsletter Pipeline on n8n

# Overview: 

This project creates an automated pipeline for generating and sending AI-powered newsletters using n8n, a workflow automation tool. The workflow integrates an AI model to generate newsletter content, formats it, and automates email distribution.

# Workflow

1) Workflow Setup in n8n — Configure an automation workflow with multiple connected nodes.

2) AI Content Generation — Use an AI agent (e.g., LLM API) to generate newsletter content dynamically.

3) Content Formatting — Apply custom JavaScript/Python code snippets inside n8n Code Nodes to structure the output into a clean, email-friendly format.

4) Email Automation — Connect with email services (e.g., Gmail/SMTP) to automatically send the formatted newsletter to recipients.

5) Error Handling & Logging — Add fallback and error nodes to capture issues during execution.

6) Conclusion — The pipeline demonstrates how n8n can orchestrate AI models with automation for a fully hands-free newsletter system.
