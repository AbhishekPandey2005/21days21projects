Web Automation on Autopilot: Building an AI Browser Agent

# Overview

This project demonstrates how to build an autonomous browser agent that can perform tasks such as searching, navigating, and extracting information from the web without manual intervention. Using crewai, Browserbase, and LLM-powered reasoning, the agent interacts with websites like a human but with automated intelligence.

# Workflow

    Environment Setup
    
      Install and configure crewai and crewai_tools.
      
      Setup API keys for Browserbase, OpenAI, Anthropic, Groq, or Ollama depending on preferred LLMs.
    
    Tool Integration
    
      Use BrowserbaseLoadTool to control the browser programmatically.
      
      Enable navigation, clicks, form submissions, and data extraction.
    
    Agent Creation
    
      Define an AI Agent with a specific role (e.g., researcher, navigator).
    
      Give it goals and backstory to determine how it interacts with the browser.
    
      Example: “Find the latest AI research papers and summarize them.”
    
    Automation Execution
    
      The agent launches a browser instance via Browserbase.
      
      Performs multi-step web navigation (search → open results → extract → summarize).
      
      Stores findings in a structured format.
    
    Evaluation & Results
    
      Validates that the browser agent can handle dynamic content.
      
      Successfully extracts targeted data without manual browsing.
    
    Conclusion
    
      The project shows how AI-driven browser automation can replace manual workflows.
      
      Extensions may include:
    
        Automating form submissions (applications, bookings).
        
        Market research bots.
        
        Competitor analysis & news monitoring.
        
        Seamless integration with databases or dashboards.
