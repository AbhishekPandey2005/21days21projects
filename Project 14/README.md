  Build Your Own GPT: Creating a Custom Text Generation Engine

# Overview: 
  This project demonstrates how to build a custom text generation engine inspired by GPT. Using Hugging Face’s Transformers and PyTorch, the notebook shows how to   load a pretrained GPT-2 model, tokenize text, fine-tune for specific tasks, and generate coherent text outputs.

# Workflow

  1) Model & Tokenizer Setup — Load GPT2LMHeadModel and GPT2Tokenizer from Hugging Face Transformers.
  
  2) Text Preprocessing — Encode input prompts into tokens for the model to process.
  
  3) Text Generation — Generate sequences using techniques like greedy decoding, top-k sampling, or nucleus (top-p) sampling.
  
  4) Fine-tuning (Optional) — Adapt the GPT-2 model on custom datasets to specialize text generation.
  
  5) Evaluation — Generate multiple outputs, analyze coherence, diversity, and creativity.
  
  6) Conclusion — The project shows how custom GPT-like engines can be built and experimented with; extensions may include larger transformer models, reinforcement   learning with human feedback, or domain-specific fine-tuning.
