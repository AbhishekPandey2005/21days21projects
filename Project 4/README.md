AI in Healthcare: Building a Life-Saving Heart Disease Predictor

# Overview: 

This project applies machine learning to predict the likelihood of heart disease from patient health data. By combining preprocessing, feature engineering, and classification algorithms, the notebook demonstrates how AI can support healthcare decision-making.

# Workflow

1) Data Acquisition — Fetch and load dataset via KaggleHub.

2) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) — Visualize correlations and trends using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

3) Preprocessing — Handle missing values with SimpleImputer, scale numerical features, and encode categorical variables with OneHotEncoder.

4) Pipeline Construction — Use ColumnTransformer and Pipeline for streamlined preprocessing and modeling.

5) Model Training — Train Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier for prediction.

6) Evaluation — Assess models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

7) Conclusion — Random Forest showed strong predictive power; extensions may include hyperparameter tuning, gradient boosting models, and deployment as a healthcare app.
