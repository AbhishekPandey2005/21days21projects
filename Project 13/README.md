Nifty 50 Stock Price Prediction

# Overview: 

This project predicts Nifty 50 stock price trends using a combination of classical machine learning models and deep learning approaches. Various regression models and neural architectures are tested for forecasting accuracy.

# Workflow

1) Data Loading — Import and preprocess Nifty 50 stock market data.

2) Feature Engineering — Create input features, handle missing values, and prepare training/testing datasets.

3) Modeling with ML Algorithms — Train models like Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, SVR, and KNN for prediction.

4) Advanced Models — Train XGBoost, LightGBM, and deep learning models (RNN, LSTM, GRU, Bidirectional RNNs) using TensorFlow/Keras.

5) Evaluation — Compare models using MAE, MSE, RMSE, and visualize prediction performance.

6) Conclusion — Ensemble and deep models show better results; improvements can include hyperparameter tuning, feature engineering, and attention-based networks.
